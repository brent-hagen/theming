:: Notes
Because of their notoriety, we consider that a "crime" theme is topical to the
story when a character unambiguously commits such a crime. For example
"murder" becomes topical if a murder is committed. Common sense is required
here: For example, action movies frequently feature actions that would
arguably be "crimes" to a thoughtful conscientious viewer, yet are not treated
as such in the story for one reason or another (action heroes often appear to
be above the law). It is not the purpose of this category to catalog such
things.
