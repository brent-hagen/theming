In real life most bank robberies are made at gunpoint, i.e., by threatening

convenience. This definition may well (and rightly should) be revisited in the
future.

In talesoftheunexpected5x06 "The Moles", two old friends whose business faced
financial ruin hatched a clever plan to tunnel their way into a certain bank
vault from an antique shop adjacent to it.
