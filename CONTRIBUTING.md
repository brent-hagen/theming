## Contributing Workflow

Here’s the recommended way to go about contributing to the project:

1. [Fork this repository][fork] to your account.
2. [Create a branch][branch] for the contribution you intend to make.
3. Make your changes to your fork.
4. [Send a pull request][pr] from your fork’s branch to the `master` branch.

## Propose to Revise an Existing Theme

Themes are always to be considered works in progress.
Submit a [propose to revise an existing theme](https://github.com/theme-ontology/theming/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=propose-to-revise-an-existing-theme.md&title=) issue to make a suggestion for how to improve on a theme.

## Propose a New Theme

## Update the Thematic Annotations of an Existing Story

There are lots of ways to help to improve on the thematically annotated stories that are currently stored in the repository, including
* Adding missing story metadata (e.g. year of release, author, references, etc.)
* Improving on story descriptions. A good description consists of a little blurb of what the story is about.
* Improving on thematic annotation motivations.
* Adding themes.
* Challenging invalid thematic annotations.

## Submit a Thematically Annotated Story that does not already Exist in the Repository

The main way to contribute is by familiarizing yourself with the nuts and blots of how to thematically annotate stories, as described in this wiki, and then have fun theming what ever stories you please.
It's always a good idea to thematically annotate stories in collaboration with others, if you can.
